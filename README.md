## How it works
Word searches are made using the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/), a really powerful word-finding query engine. By combining the keywords in different ways, it is possible to get a large list of relevant words. These are then filtered based on how common they are using data from [Google Books Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) (also provided by the API). The final words are sorted based on relevance, length and ease of pronunciation and displayed alongside their definitions, pronunciations and useful tools to check how good of a name it would be.

</p>



----
The sorting algorithm currently uses the following equation to calculate a score for each word:

```js
appearences(A) - 0.2*length(A)
```
In the future this will also include ease of pronunciation and frequency
